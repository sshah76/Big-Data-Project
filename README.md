## Flight Delay & Cancellation Analysis

# Overview

This project analyzes U.S. flight data to uncover patterns in delays, cancellations, and travel trends within the aviation sector. The goal is to identify key factors affecting flight performance, such as weather conditions, operational inefficiencies, and airline-specific issues. Through data-driven insights, we aim to enhance operational efficiency, predict disruptions, and improve the overall passenger experience.


# Key Objectives

Identify the primary causes of flight delays and cancellations.

Analyze seasonal trends, peak travel periods, and consumer behavior.

Develop machine learning models to predict flight cancellations.

Provide actionable insights for airlines, airports, and policymakers to optimize operations.


# Dataset

The analysis is based on publicly available U.S. flight data, which includes:

Flight schedules and actual departure/arrival times.

Delay and cancellation reasons (e.g., weather, carrier-related, air traffic control).

Airport and airline performance metrics.

Seasonal and time-based trends.

# Methodology

# 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identify trends in delays, cancellations, and flight performance.

Examine time-based variations (hourly, daily, monthly trends).

Assess the impact of weather conditions and airline operations.

# 2. Machine Learning Approach:

Build predictive models for flight cancellations using factors such as weather and airport congestion.

Utilize a Random Forest model to determine key predictors and improve accuracy.

# 3. Insights & Recommendations:

Highlight the most affected airlines and airports.

Provide data-driven strategies for mitigating delays and cancellations.

Suggest improvements in scheduling and resource allocation.


# Usage

1. For Airlines: Improve scheduling efficiency and reduce operational disruptions.

2. For Airports: Optimize infrastructure and resource planning based on travel patterns.

3. For Passengers: Understand travel trends to make informed booking decisions.
